<p id="narrative">
  Hey, there fellow traveler! The year is 2560 BC, you are traveling across Egypt as a scribe with the intention to locate and cherish the recently built pyramid, the Great Pyramid of Giza dedicated to the pharaoh's tomb, King Khufu. As a scribe, you help anyone and everyone you meet that is in need of reading or writing services. With this job, you never find it out of the ordinary for anyone to stop you on the paths and ask for help. As you find yourself entering the city of Giza, an older gentleman stops to ask you for help with deciphering a piece of text written on a secluded stone wall. As you translate the message it states, "MKFUT BOHU". As <!-- message unscattered: KHUFU TOMB--> confused as you are, you turn around to find the old man become hostile and hits you over the head with a rock! You are knocked
unconscious and have been kidnapped!
  <br>
  ...
  <br>
  You awake in a dimly lit room, unsure of where you are or how much time has passed. You try and push the thought of not seeing the Great Pyramid out of your head. Instead, you look around and notice that you are in a stone-built room with small sand piles scattered about. As you sit on the floor confused and fearful, you attempt to remember the events that led you here...
