<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Hey, there fellow traveler! The year is 2560 BC, you are traveling across Egypt as a scribe with the intention to locate and cherish the recently built pyramid, the Great Pyramid of Giza dedicated to the pharaoh's tomb, King Khufu. As a scribe, you help anyone and everyone you meet that is in need of reading or writing services. With this job, you never find it out of the ordinary for anyone to stop you on the paths and ask for help. As you find yourself entering the city of Giza, an older gentleman stops to ask you for help with deciphering a piece of text written on a secluded stone wall. As you translate the message it states, "MKFUT BOHU". As <!-- message unscattered: KHUFU TOMB--> confused as you are, you turn around to find the old man become hostile and hits you over the head with a rock! You are knocked
unconscious and have been kidnapped!
  <br>
  ...
  <br>
  You awake in a dimly lit room, unsure of where you are or how much time has passed. You try and push the thought of not seeing the Great Pyramid out of your head. Instead, you look around and notice that you are in a stone-built room with small sand piles scattered about. As you sit on the floor confused and fearful, you attempt to remember the events that led you here...
</p>
<h2 id="unscramble">Unscramble the Message</h2>
<p>
  This puzzle will require the player to translate a jumbled message. This puzzle's clue can be found within the description, the message the player translated: MKFUT BOHU. The unscrambled message is KHUFU TOMB. This fits into the theme because the Great Pyramid of Giza is a tomb for King Khufu. This puzzle will require the message displayed on a crumbled piece of stone wall and a text input box for when the player completes the unscrambled message. The reward will identify the location the player is at (the Great Pyramid of Giza).
</p>
<h2 id="goddessnut">Reveal of Goddess Nut Riddle</h2>
<p>
  This puzzle will require two different images both including Goddess Nut. However, one will include a riddle stating, "O my Goddess, stretch Yourself over me, that I may be placed among the imperishable stars which are in You, and that I may not die". This riddle will require the player to use Ancient Egyptian knowledge to reveal that the woman stretching over the gods is Goddess Nut. The answer to this puzzle will be "Nut" and the reward will be a clue for the next puzzle stating to look for the tomb's pharaoh. This puzzle also contains clues for the last puzzle. Overall, this puzzle will require two images, a riddle, and an input text box. This puzzle fits into the theme because Goddess Nut is the Sky Goddess of Egypt and the riddle is a passage from the Book of the Dead.

<h2 id="khufustatue">Identify the Khufu Statue</h2>
<p>
  This puzzle will contain 5 statues each of different pharaohs (Narmer, Khufu, Ramesses II, Nefertiti, and Amenhotep III) and the player must identify which statue is King Khufu. The materials required for this puzzle are 5 images of the pharaoh statues, a click input, and a correct/incorrect message for when the player clicks on the correct/incorrect statue. This puzzle goes with the theme of the escape room because all of the statues used were real people and actual statues recovered from Egypt. The reward will be revealed under the Khufu statue and it will be a note that provides a code alphabet of hieroglyphics that will be used in a later puzzle.

<h2 id="morsecode">Morse Code Message with Light</h2>
<p>
  Within this puzzle, the player will spot a small hole in the wall with flickering light. The flickering light will be morse code that reveals a message stating, "Sand". The message is the reward for the player as a clue for the next puzzle. The player will look under the small sand piles around the room revealing the next puzzle. This will require an image or video of flashing yellow color (representing light) seen through a peephole/crack, a morse code alphabet to help the player, and an input text box for the message the player deciphers. This puzzle relates to the theme because the sound of morse code wasn't a thing yet during this time period, it relates back to the small sand piles that were mentioned in the description, and there is a peephole/crack because it is a pyramid.
</p>
<h2 id="hieroglyphics">Decode the Hieroglyphics</h2>
<p>
  This puzzle requires the completion of identifying the Khufu statue to obtain the hieroglyphics code alphabet. Next, the player will decipher a message written in red hieroglyphics stating, "Ra is leader". The reward will be the message used as a clue to solving the last puzzle. The materials required for this puzzle will be an image of the hieroglyphics code alphabet, another image of the hieroglyphics message, and a text input box for the answer. This goes along with the theme because hieroglyphics originated from Ancient Egypt and Nut is a real goddess from Egypt with her job being to protect gods in the afterlife.
</p>
<h2 id="door">Unlock the Hidden Door</h2>
<p>
  This puzzle is a cipher wheel that is locking the door to escape the hidden chamber. The cipher wheel contains 2 dials: one with names of different gods (Ra, Horus, Bastet, Thoth, Isis, Osiris, Anubis, Nut, and Amun) and the other with numbers 1-10. The player is expected to use the clue from decoding the hieroglyphics to unlock the door. The correct dial combination is Ra (he is the leader of the solar boat that was presented in the Goddess Nut puzzle) and the number 9 (the number of gods on the boat (image from the Goddess Nut puzzle) including Ra). The reward will be escaping the hidden chamber and unlocking the conclusion. This puzzle follows the theme because it uses images from previous puzzles, real art from Ancient Egypt, and real gods from Ancient Egypt. This puzzle will require all the items that the player has found previously, all the answers to the previous puzzles the player has solved, and a text input for the answer. The items and answers will be provided to help the player solve this puzzle.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Finally, after all these mind-twisters, you manage to push the small door open to reveal a long downward shaft. There is no other way out; so you sigh to yourself and hop into the shaft, legs first, and slide your way down. You finally see light at the end of the tunnel revealing an exit that brings you into another room. You find yourself surrounded by different copper tools along with a wooden slat with hieroglyphic writing on the walls. You see an open doorway! You run out of the doorway leading you into the Grand Gallery. You find another opening with shining, bright light. As you exit the structure into the daylight, sure enough, you are standing before the Great Pyramid of Giza!
  <br>
  <br>
  The conclusion will be an ending narrative (the text above) concluding the story and giving some real insight into the Great Pyramid of Giza. The narrative contains things that line up with real history with Egypt. The air shaft leading from the chamber and into another room (historians now call it the Queen's Chamber), the copper objects and wooden slat found inside the room, and the Grand Gallery are all real rooms and items found inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. The real-world reward that the player will receive is video footage of the robot that was sent into the Pyramid in attempt to investigate the hidden chamber and explains the story behind the project. The project was titled, Djedi Project (the name of the robot) and was launched in 2011 by a group of Egyptian experts. The project consisted of experts launching a tiny robot into the airshaft above the Queen's Chamber into a chamber that reveals a hidden door to another hidden chamber that no one has been able to get into and explore (this is the chamber that the player is in in the narrative). So, the mystery is what is behind that secluded door that the [supposed] airshaft led to. The conclusion narrative and reward goes with the theme because it is a real-world project that happened and the narrative relates to the real-world items and layout of the pyramid.
