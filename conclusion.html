<p class="paras">Finally, after all these mind-twisters, you manage to push the small door open to reveal a long downward shaft. There is no other way out; so you sigh to yourself and hop into the shaft, legs first, and slide your way down. You finally see light at the end of the tunnel revealing an exit that brings you into another room. You find yourself surrounded by different copper tools along with a wooden slat with hieroglyphic writing on the walls. Although intrigued by the items, you are ready to get out of here. You see an open doorway! You run out of the doorway leading you into the Grand Gallery. As you exit the structure into the daylight, sure enough, you are standing before the Great Pyramid of Giza!</p>

<p class="paras">Did you know that the hidden chamber is an actual room in the Great Pyramid of Giza? Yes, in 1992 a group of Ancient Egyptian experts and researchers attempted to investigate the abandon airshafts within the pyramid connected to the Queen's Chamber. This was named the Upuaut Project and the plan was to launch a small robot with a camera into the shaft to investigate. The shaft turned out to be 60 meters long that ended in a solid block with two metal handles. With this in mind, this made experts and researchers even more eager to discover what was behind the solid door.</p>
  
<p class="paras">In 2011, another project was lauched titled the Djedi Project. The project had the same plan as the previous one but this time, experts would drill a hole into the solid door to bypass. Behind the solid wall appeared to be <u>another</u> 50 meter shaft ending with <u>another</u> solid block. By drilling another hole for the robot to go through, researchers discovered a small chamber with red markings on the floor and wall. The solid block even had metal handles from inside the chamber indicating a greater purpose. Now, Ancient Egyptian historians and experts are trying to piece together this discovery into what the purpose was of this chamber.</p>
